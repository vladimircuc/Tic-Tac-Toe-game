## About The Project

!!! This project was created in my first semester of college, therefore it does not apply the standard OOP styling !!!     

My project mimics a game of Tic-Tac-Tow that players can play against the computer or against each other. The easy mode is designed to make a lot of mistakes, the medium mode is designed to make few mistakes and the hard mode is designed to rarely make a mistake, making it really hard to win against. The Program also has the option of checking the history and evolution of the game in time.     

The Tic-Tac-Toe Game has 3 options:    
1. Difficulty:
     a. Easy Mode    
     b. Medium Mode    
     c. Hard Mode    
     d. Multiplayer (2 players at the same computer needed)
     e. Quit (returns to the previous screen)
2. Training (a series of game scenarios)
3. Origin of Tic-Tac-Toe (brief history of the game)
     a. Origins
     b. Evolution
     c. Quit (returns to the previous screen)
4. Quit (closes the program)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* [Java 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) or higher

### Installation

1. Download the main Python file
2. Run the program    

### Running

Once running the user needs to type a number according to the action desired from the menus    
The program has instructions throughout the game    

## Notes   

!!! This project was created in my first semester of college, therefore it does not apply the standard OOP styling !!!     

## Evaluation

The program has good stability due to the error encountering solutions implemented. The user must insert only values accepted by the program at the current stage of the game. Any other input would throw an error and ask the user to try again.       
I have tested most possible cases, and the program runs as it should.      
If I had more time and knowledge at the time when I created the project, I would have implemented a better interface for a better user experience.     
I would have done things differently if I were to recreate the project. I would have created classes and objects throughout the project, including the OOP styling methods.    

<!--
Discuss the stability of your implementation. What works well? Are there any bugs? Is everything tested properly? Are there still features that have not been implemented? Also, if you had the time, what improvements would you make to your implementation? Are there things which you would have done completely differently? Try to aim for at least 250 words.

<!--
If you implemented any extras, you can list/mention them here.
