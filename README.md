## About The Project

<!-- Add short description about the project here -->

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* [Java 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) or higher
* [Maven 3.6](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) or higher

### Installation

1. Navigate to the `stocks` directory
2. Clean and build the project using:
```sh
mvn install
```

### Running

<!--
Describe how to run your program here. These should be a few very simple steps.
-->

## Modules

<!--
Describe each module in the project, what their purpose is and how they are used in your program. Try to aim for at least 100 words per module.
-->

## Design

<!--
List all the design patterns you used in your program. For every pattern, describe the following:
- Where it is used in your application.
- What benefit it provides in your application. Try to be specific here. For example, don't just mention a pattern improves maintainability, but explain in what way it does so.
-->

## Evaluation

<!--
Discuss the stability of your implementation. What works well? Are there any bugs? Is everything tested properly? Are there still features that have not been implemented? Also, if you had the time, what improvements would you make to your implementation? Are there things which you would have done completely differently? Try to aim for at least 250 words.
-->

## Extras

<!--
If you implemented any extras, you can list/mention them here.
